              <p>
                I'm a Web Developer who loves turning ideas into something that
                is both useful and interactive.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have successfully completed my skills as a developer through
                SAIT's Information Technology course and currently expanding my
                knowledge as a web develoer through SAITâ€™s Web Developer
                Certificate program.
              </p>

                My goal is to provide fast, interactive, and responsive
                websites.
